# Fun Image Generation!
A fun project I made in a few hours, for fun and to experiment with perlin noise, convolutional filters, and a few other cool ideas. Image generation settings are customizable - here are some sample images using my favorite settings:

![Image 1](sample_images/image_001.png?raw=true "Image 1. Complexity: 1")

![Image 2](sample_images/image_004.png?raw=true "Image 2. Complexity: 4")

![Image 3](sample_images/image_010.png?raw=true "Image 3. Complexity: 10")
